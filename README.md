# graph-traversal
1. The algorithm is meant to decide for a given (not necessarily connected) graph, given points U and V, if a path exists between U and V. A DFS is used for the implementation of this solution.
2. This is a variant of the Minimum Spanning Tree problem with an additional requirement: specified edges that must be included in the final tree. Prim's algorithm is used for the implementation of this solution.
3. This is another variant of the MST problem, an extension of (2), where there is an additional requirement: a specified set of vertices which must be connected to exactly 1 edge. This solution again uses Prim's algorithm.
